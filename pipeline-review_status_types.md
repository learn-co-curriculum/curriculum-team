# Review Status Types

## Define Objectives

In this stage, either you or someone from the Flatiron team will be defining
the learning objectives/outline for the content. 

If you're defining the learning objectives, then in the Readme file of the
GitHub repository, list your objectives and any additional outlines that will
help flesh out the structure and info to be included in the Readme. Once you've
done this, then you change the status to Ready for Assignment. In the Owner
column, add your name. 

If this is the responsibility of a Flatiron team member, then you can ignore
any piece of content that's in this stage as it's not Ready for Assignment.

## Ready for Assignment

The lesson is ready for assignment. This means that the Readme in the repo will
have a list of learning objectives and sometimes additional notes as guidance.

## Writing

When you are ready to get started on a specific lesson, change the stage from
Ready for Assignment to Writing. Then in the Assignee column, update it to your
name. If you haven't done so in the Owner column, update it to your name as
well.

When you're working on the lesson, DON'T make your commits into the `master`
branch. **Instead** create a new branch and title it `wip-master` (or
`wip-solution`, depending on the branch you're pushing the commits to).
Code/type your content into this branch.

Remember to add the `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `LICENSE.md`, and `.learn` files.

## Review

When the lesson is ready for review, change the stage from Writing to Review.
Then create a Pull Request from your `wip-*` branch. Remove yourself from the
Assignee column. Someone from the Curriculum team at Flatiron will assign the
PR to the appropriate reviewer and will update the Assignee column.

In the review process, the reviewer will usually have questions or comments
which he or she will make in the PR itself. If there are no comments or issues,
then the PR will be assigned back to you and is good to merge/ship. Either way,
the PR will always be assigned back to you and based on the comments, you can
either merge it, fix and merge it, or fix and assign back for another review.

## Complete

When a PR has been successfully merged, you can change the stage to Complete.
