## Writing Stages

When we write a new piece of curriculum, we take the piece through several
stages. At each stage we request reviews from our peers to confirm that the
piece is on the right track before moving on to the next stage. You can use the
following as a guide to each stage and what qualities a reviewer will check for.

## Sizing

The first step in writing a new curriculum piece is determining how long it will
take to write. The goal of this phase is to help the management team make sure
that the time required to deliver the product matches the time we _estimate_
delivery will take.

This process may happen days or even weeks ahead of writing!

A good analogy is like software. If the user stories to deliver a feature
wind up being larger than the time available for the team, then that features
**does not get delivered**. Same thing here. Having an estimate allows management
to "trade" and "shift around" objectives. Your estimation is a vital part of
understanding the scope of the project.

Additionally, it's a chance to do some early expectation alignment. If the
planner of the "brick" or "module" thinks that a topic is a 2 hour thing and
you think it's a 2 week thing, then there's clearly some misalignment. This
is a good chance to calibrate our expectations.

Estimation involves considering the topic's complexity, whether or not
there is existing material on the same topic, the necessity of graphic assets
and other similar factors. The resulting estimation (in number of minutes) helps
us schedule work and reviews efficiently.

**Note:** Make sure to check the [Learn curriculum
tracks](https://learn.co/curriculum/) for existing lessons on the topic you're
writing about. We can adapt relevant concepts to the new piece, but we'll
build a new outline from scratch before porting over any content. If you
notice that we have a particularly apt lesson in the Learn.co archives, don't
fall into the trap of thinking "copy and paste and done!" and estimating low.
Sometimes digging into legacy "copy and pasted" content requires more effort
than focused from-scratch writing.

## Outlining

After sizing, we create a lessons's outline. This is where we:

* Determine the title
* Determine **Learning Goals**
* Ensure headings align with the **Learning Goals**
* Identify any necessary subheadings
* List of resources (where necessary)

We also write introduction and conclusion text at this point.

As we put together the outline, we want to consider the following guidelines:

- Create (or continue from earlier lessons in the same brick) a narrative example.
    - The narrative example should present a problem.
    - It should also create a sense of urgency to solve that problem.
    - It should provide enough clear details for the scenario to be relatable and understandable
- Define **Learning Goals** on focused topics.
  - If necessary, do research on the topic at hand to see what others feel are important to know about it.
  - Organize the learning goals in such a way they will flow well together.
  - When discussing intro or “beginner” topics, be sure to break down concepts into more granular learning goals. Don’t assume the student has a technical background and will automatically understand.
- Write a strong **Introduction**.
  - Be careful not to make too many really specific pop culture references that some students, especially international, may not understand.
  - This is where you might establish a handful of keywords, _emphasized_, that you will be defining and discussing throughout the lesson.
  - Define, define, define!
- Write a rough **Conclusion** by summarizing what was discussed in the **Learning Goals**.
  - If there will be more lessons following this one in the same brick, we can preview what will come in the next lesson.
  - We can write a couple of sentences that reassure the student that they will be be able to understand the content with practice, or explain why everything they just read will be important in their learning journey and dev career.
- List any resources or assets we know the lesson will need.

Overall, we want to make sure that the outline effectively lays out the
structure of the piece, establishes the introduction and conclusion and makes
note of assets or resources the piece will need to be complete.

## Writing the Rough Draft

Once the outline has been approved by the reviewer, we move on to the full first
draft. When writing a lesson rough draft, keep the following guidelines in mind:

- Flesh out the details for each Learning Goal. 
  - No high-level abstraction
  - If the added bulk of the Learning Goals is making the lesson very long (1000 words or more), consider breaking out additional Learning Goals and topics into a new lesson.
  - If a Learning Goal has many sub-topics that are more than a couple of paragraphs, consider making them their own Learning Goals.
- Be thoughtful about code examples and/or imagery. 
  - Add existing graphics where needed to illustrate points.
  - Accompany concepts with examples, or begin to make notes where specific graphics will be dropped.
  - Provide examples with enough detail. 
    - Make sure all variables, functions, or other relevant parts of code samples are defined in the code block.
  - Preference is given to images/gifs that illustrate a concept over media that are “reactions” (like a celebratory thumbs up), and other extraneous media content that isn’t furthering a student’s understanding of a concept.
  - An educational gif may be something like a Terminal window that we see in TV and movies, or what a real terminal window looks like on a computer.
- Write on a 6th to 8th grade level.
  - Do not to use overly complex words. 
  - If technical terms need to be used, make sure they are being defined either in the narrative, or in parenthesis. ex: “the command line interface (also known as CLI)"
- When writing narratives or metaphors, keep them as relatable as possible to the broadest audience. eg: References to common experiences like a list students in various classrooms, vs. Harry Potter and Harry Potter specific references that might involve different Harry Potter houses that not everyone will have context on.
- Again - define, define, define! 
  - Make sure key words or phrases introduced in each Learning Goal is explained to the appropriate level of learner.
  - For example, when discussing file structure and navigation, is the concept of a "directory tree" explained before referring to movement "up and down?"
- Are all shortcuts, acronyms or commands defined or explained?
  - For example: the `-v` flag in `git remote -v` stands for "verbose"
- Material does not simply assert something is true without showing why or describing a scenario where that knowledge is important
- If possible, over-using vague and colloquial language like “stuff” and “things”, or “radical” or “gnarly” that is not to be translated literally.
- Be aware of [Curriculum style guide](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/curriculum-team/blob/master/style_guide.md) usage. Tick off code words, capitalize where necessary, make sure formatting is correct, etc.
- Make adjustments as needed to the Conclusion now that the concepts have be covered more thoroughly.

Our goal for the rough draft is to put all the essential material into place. It
does need to be thorough, but it doesn't need to be perfect. We'll polish in the
next stage.

## Writing the Final Draft

After we submit our rough draft, we'll receive useful feedback from our
reviewer. We can then incorporate that feedback into the next draft. As you're
moving through this stage of writing, here are some questions to ask yourself:

- Are sentences too long?
  - Break them up into shorter, succinct sentences that are easier to understand. 
  - Whitespace is easier on the eyes for reading. Paragraphs can be short and less dense than we may be used to seeing in literature.
- Are there any remaining grammatical errors and typos?
  - This is especially likely to happen if changes were made since the rough draft.
- Are all new vocabulary or important terms bolded or italicized in the text where appropriate to indicate their introduction/importance? Are they defined and/or explained?
- Are there existing graphics where needed to illustrate points?
- Are all concepts accompanied with examples?
- Are all examples provided with enough detail?
- Is the reading level appropriate? 
- Are there any additional resources that need to be added?

We now have a perfectly polished new piece of curriculum—we think, at least. One
more review, likely from a project lead or manager, and we can call this lesson
approved and done.
