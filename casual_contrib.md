# How Can I Help

Hi!

First of all, thanks for taking a look here. In Curriculum we have a ton of
work and a ton of stakeholders (students, teachers, coaches, employers). We're
busy!

Thanks for even considering giving a moment of your precious time.

## Baseline

Many requests take the form of "Can I make a change?" or "Can I update
something?" The answer is YES. How well and quickly we can integrate these
challenges is a major question for the road ahead.

## I Want To Update a Lesson Or Lab

We call these "targeted fixes" (it's a small thing...) or "repository fixes"
(the flow or explanation are off).

1. Read the [style guide](./style_guide.md)
1. Create a pull request with your change **OR** Create an issue that reports the problem. These will be created in the Learn.Co **Curriculum** respository. Example: `http://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/lesson-with-issue`
1. **ALSO** Please add a `#staff` at the end of your PR or Issue.
1. Create an entry via the [form][]

We review the form at our weekly staff meeting on Mondays.

## I Want To Change The Way We Teach a Topic (order)

Phew, this one is a bit dicier. What if your change sets us backward (I'm sure
it won't) or what if another teacher disagrees with you? And how will whatever
process we describe here work with more schools and more curricula?

Write your perspective, point of view, recommendation, edits etc. Then use
the [form][] to alert us to the presence of the issue and we'll be in contact.

We review the form at our weekly staff meeting on Mondays.

## My Students are Stymied, we have a PR, why won't you merge it!?!

Curriculum was (re-)born in 2018 with a backlog of ~600 issues dating
from the ~2 year time period when the team was disbanded. As of January
2018 we are trying to 1) advance business strategy by releasing new
products releases, etc. ("projects") and balancing that against 2)
needs to maintain and sustain the existing operation ("ops"). Where
there is a bug that's been ignored and a fix is present, please use the
Slack channel `#curriculum` as an interrupt to put our attention on something
in a timely fashion.

Bear in mind order and structure issues are far less easily integrated, but
"point" fixes to repos should be implement-able quickly, once our "interrupt"
is activated.
