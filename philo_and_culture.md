# Philosophy and Culture

## Introduction

The goal here is to describe some of the values and beliefs which define the
Flatiron School culture and which influence the curricular voice. As the
organization grows larger, we should be aligned in the style and voice we adopt
as writers.

## Qualities

### Irreverent

Our voice is irreverent. While we are never _offensive_, we are irreverent. We
think it's just as interesting to name the turtles in our [LOGO][] clone
Rihanna, Beyonc&eacute;, and W. Axl Tortuga.

### Open / Inclusive / Accessible

We are in a scaling phase. We must, therefore, make sure that our examples,
sample code, joke breaks, .gifs, etc. appeal to audiences larger than New York
City, larger than the East Coast, larger than the United States. Our amibitions
are worldwide, our examples must be as well. Inside knowledge (the NYC grid,
the rules of cricket, etc.) should be recognized as being exclusionary.
Worldwide media juggernauts but must be used sparingly and with care lest the
curriculum grow treacly or over-precious.

## Pedagogical Approach

We want to begin in the middle, jummp to the bottom, spiral upward back to
the middle, and then launch upward.

## Embrace Doing it by Hand

"At the end, we're not teaching students to use an API, we're teaching them
...to think as an engineer." &mdash; Jason Decker

The classical example here is that we would ask students to write their own
ORM. They should come to appreciate the way it abstracts out the pluralized
nouns in their SQL queries, but also understand how brittle it is. When
introducing powerful APIs e.g. ActiveRecord we want to explain not _how_ to
use it exclusively, but also cover the _why_ it exists and the _what_ things
like AR (i.e. _any_ ORM) must do.

If, when we reveal the power tool, students feel upset that we made them
"do it by hand," then we succeeded.
