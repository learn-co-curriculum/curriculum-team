# Philosophy and Culture

## Introduction

The goal here is to describe some of the values and beliefs which define the
Flatiron School culture and which influence the curricular voice. As the
organization grows larger, we should be aligned in the style and voice we adopt
as writers.

## Qualities

### Irreverent

Our voice is irreverent. While we are never _offensive_, we are irreverent. We
think it's just as interesting to name the turtles in our [LOGO][] clone
Rihanna, Beyonc&eacute;, and W. Axl Tortuga.

### Open / Inclusive / Accessible

We are in a scaling phase. We must, therefore, make sure that our examples,
sample code, joke breaks, .gifs, etc. appeal to audiences larger than New York
City, larger than the East Coast, larger than the United States. Our amibitions
are worldwide, our examples must be as well. Inside knowledge (the NYC grid,
the rules of cricket, etc.) should be recognized as being exclusionary.
Worldwide media juggernauts but must be used sparingly and with care lest the
curriculum grow treacly or over-precious.

## Pedagogical Approach

We want to begin in the middle, jummp to the bottom, spiral upward back to the middle, and then launch upward.
