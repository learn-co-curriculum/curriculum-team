## Four types of issues
 * The issue is simply a misunderstanding the student has. Please tell them to ask a question using Slack or the ask a question feature and close the issue
 ```
 Hello,

It looks like this isn't a bug in the curriculum, but a misunderstanding you have with the material. That's no problem though! Go ahead and hit the Ask A Question button on learn.co. Either a community member or a technical coach will be able to help you understand this stuff.

Good luck.
```
 * The issue is a bug in the IDE. Tell them, this looks like a bug with your IDE setup please email support@flatironschool.com or refer to our help center here: http://help.learn.co/the-learn-ide
 
 ```
 Hello,
 
 Looks like this may actually be a problem with your Learn IDE. To get this resolved, send an email to support@flatironschool.com or take a look at our help center here: http://help.learn.co/the-learn-ide.
 
 Good luck
 ```
 * This actually is an issue with the lab! Make a PR, tag the PR against the Issue and then close the issue and PR
 * This is an issue that you can't replicate. Ask the reporter for more details...then check back in a week. If they haven't responded close the issue (with a smile! and a comment) and ask them to re-open if they come across the issue again.

**Once you complete the PR you have two options:**

 * It’s something simple. Things like “spec_helper wasn’t included”. Just test it, and then merge it in. Generally these are things that are just “doesn’t work”
 * It is a large “doesn’t work” this means writing a lot of text in the README, writing a ton of tests, changing significant portions of the solution. Tag me (jmburges) as the assignee and I’ll take a look!
