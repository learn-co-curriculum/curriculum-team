## Learning Objectives

Following your overview, list the objectives of your lesson. (If you’re
creating the entire course or unit from scratch and have done a high level
outline, the objectives will connect to and build from the action
items/skills/knowledge that you listed for each of your lessons.) 

Objectives should be a bulleted list that finishes the sentence *"Students will
be able to..."*

Let’s take a closer look at learning objectives.

### Aren’t Learning Objectives Just An Outline of the Content? 

Learning objectives shouldn’t focus on just the content, but rather what the
student should be able to do or show after completing the content. Typically,
what they need to be able to do or show will be most clearly evidence in the
subsequent labs that they need to complete after reading the Readme.

Once you know this information, then you can start thinking about the content
you need to include in your Readme for the student to be able to meet those
objectives. In other words, objectives help make the content that you will
eventually write student-centered, and you’ll get better at removing
unnecessary content that might sound nice to you, but ultimately doesn’t help
students accomplish anything or solve problems.

And for students, knowing the learning objectives before diving into a lesson
makes them aware whether they are learning, practicing, and applying the
specific skills and knowledge you want them to be focusing on. 

### Got It, But How do I Actually Write One? 

All objectives share the following qualities:

1) They are observable. It should be something that a student can show so your
objective should start with an action verb such as “write, describe, operate,
create, compare, distinguish, or design.”

Avoid conceptual words like "learn, know, appreciate, understand" because
they’re not observable. Think about it &mdash; can a student really show that
they’ve learned or understood something? What other verbs can you use? 

Here’s a [list of verbs][learning-obj-verbs] to consider when writing learning
objectives.

Also here’s a quick list of verbs you can use depending on how you want
students to interact with the content:

* For ***Knowledge/Remembering*** of the content: define, list, recognize
* For ***Comprehension/Understanding*** of the content: characterize, describe, explain, identify, locate, recognize, sort
* For ***Application/Applying*** of the content: choose, demonstrate, implement, perform
* For ***Analysis/Analyzing*** of the content: analyze, categorize, compare, differentiate
* For ***Evaluation/Evaluating*** of the content: assess, critique, evaluate, rank, rate
* For ***Synthesis/Creating of the content***: construct, design, formulate, organize, synthesize

2) All objectives are also measurable and/or have specific conditions under
which they are met. What this means is be specific and let students know what
the specific conditions or standards for the learning objectives.

* Too general: *Add items to an array*
* Better: *Add items to an array using the shovel method*


* Too general: *Use the yield keyword*
* Better: *Use the yield keyword to create methods that take blocks as parameters*


* Too general: *Delete a table*
* Better: *Delete a table using the DROP TABLE command*

### Any Other Tips on Writing Objectives? 

Objectives should be cumulative. When listing your objectives, make sure that
they go in the order that they’re presented in the lesson. This will prime the
student to understand what the logical flow of the content will be, and will
also help you as you’re thinking about how to structure the content in your
lesson and what to include. 

You can also think of learning objectives as the different steps that a student
needs to complete in order to achieve the overall goal of the lesson.
Oftentimes because you’re an expert in the field, you might think that a
specific task requires just one skill or competency, but it’s actually a
combination of many of them, and each of those can potentially be its own
objective. 

### How Many Learning Objectives Should I Have in My Lesson? 

In general, have between three to five learning objectives. Avoid having more
than eight objectives. If you find yourself with more, then consider either
breaking up your lesson into multiple lessons.  

### What If the Lesson Already Has the Learning Objectives Included?

Sometimes the lessons that you’re assigned to create might already have
learning objectives included. Review the learning objectives and makes sure
that they are indeed proper objectives and not simply an outline of the
content. 

If they are an outline of the content, then think about how you can transform
them into proper learning objectives. This might mean, in some cases, that the
information given needs to be broken up into multiple learning objectives. 

Also review the objectives to make sure that you’re not including too much into
one lesson. Since you’re the one that’s writing the lesson, you’ll know better
than us whether the objectives should be split between multiple lessons. 

### After I Write My Lesson, Anything Else I Need to Do?

Review your lesson and make sure that your content is teaching to the learning
objectives. But in your review though, you might notice that your content is
actually teaching other skills and concepts that actually work better than your
original learning objectives. In that situation then, adjust your objectives to
match this new content.
