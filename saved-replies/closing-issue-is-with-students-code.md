Hi there, 

Thanks for raising this issue. Based on your description, it sounds like this issue may be related to solving this lab, rather than with the lesson itself or the instructions. The curriculum team monitors these issues so that we can fix typos and bugs in the curriculum, but we aren't equipped to provide support.

To get help with your question, you should either: 

- Reach out to your instructor
- Use the [Pair with a TC](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gko5UFzCBhpo1R0V_Tx2JHSK9cRC2b_53Ky3u5Qtzlk/edit) feature in Canvas to connect with a Technical Coach on the Academic Success Team

Please re-open this issue if you believe the lesson needs to be updated.
