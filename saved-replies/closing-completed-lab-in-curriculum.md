Hi there,

It looks like this pull request was submitted as proof of your completion of this lab/assignment by running `learn submit`. This pull request will not submit your work correctly so I am closing it. 

`learn submit` was only meant to be used with curriculum on our old Learn.co platform. Students working on Canvas only need to run `learn test` to update their assignment in Canvas and submit their work.

In the future, please refrain from using `learn submit` as it doesn't submit your work correctly, and creates unnecessary pull requests.

If you are working in Canvas, please [review these instructions](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/welcome-completing-assignments) on completing and submitting your work. 

If you continue to have difficulties, you can either: 

- Reach out to your instructor (if you've started the program and have an instructor)
- Use the [#js-prework-support](https://flatiron-school.slack.com/archives/C01KEEVJU3Y) Slack channel (if you're working on the prework)
- Use the [Pair with a TC](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gko5UFzCBhpo1R0V_Tx2JHSK9cRC2b_53Ky3u5Qtzlk/edit) feature in Canvas to connect with a Technical Coach on the Academic Success Team

Thanks! ðŸ’™
