Hello!

You're correct, there are some repeated lessons in phase 1 from the prework! This is content that we feel is especially important to review before you move forward. If you feel comfortable with the content, you are free to skim or move on. 
If you would like the lesson to be marked as completed in Canvas there are two ways you can go about this:

-  Delete your original fork of the repository and then refork and redo the lab
-  Click the "Submit Assignment" button at the top of your Canvas page and submit your repo link there.

 These repeats are mentioned in the [What To Expect in Phase 1 page](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/phase-1-welcome-what-to-expect) if you have any other questions!

Happy coding! ðŸ’™
