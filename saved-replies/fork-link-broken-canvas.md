Hello! Thanks for submitting this issue.
The fork link may not have been working because of a server error, and isn't something we can change on our end. (This is likely why the github link was still working! ðŸ˜„) 
I'm going to go ahead and close this issue, but if you think I've closed the issue in error please reopen and we will take another look!
